DELAY 500
Dear Francesca, Reading about your packed and exciting year ahead truly inspired me. You’ve immersed yourself in such an incredible variety of activities! With tennis, drama, skiing, and language learning, you’ve got such an amazing range of interests. It reminds me of when I used to balance several hobbies at once, so I know how challenging it can be to juggle everything. I think it’s fantastic that you’re studying both French and Spanish. I’ve always wanted to improve my own language skills, especially Italian, since I also have family ties in Europe. I see that you’re also gearing up for your GCSEs, which must feel like a lot on top of everything else. I remember how overwhelming exam season felt for me, too. What helped me stay on track was carving out small moments just for myself—whether that was taking a quick walk or reading something totally unrelated to school. Your idea to practice Italian during your skiing trip is brilliant—it’s such a fun way to keep learning while enjoying yourself! I understand it must be a bit disheartening to think about post-Brexit travel restrictions, but it’s wonderful that you’ll be able to get an Italian passport. I’ve always been drawn to the idea of living and working abroad, so I can relate to your excitement about exploring the world. With your determination, I have no doubt you’ll strike the right balance between everything you love and make the most of this dynamic year. I’d love to hear how things unfold for you and wish you the best of luck with your exams and all the exciting adventures to come. Warm wishes,
