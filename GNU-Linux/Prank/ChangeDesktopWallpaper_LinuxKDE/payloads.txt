DELAY 500
STRING Dear Francesca, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by the snapshot of your busy and exciting year ahead. It sounds like you’ve truly immersed yourself in so many wonderful activities! Tennis, languages, drama, and skiing—what an exciting mix of interests. I used to juggle multiple hobbies as well, and I completely understand the balancing act you’re navigating. It’s impressive that you’re learning both French and Spanish. I’ve always wanted to sharpen my language skills, especially Italian, since I, too, have some family roots in Europe. I can see you’re also preparing for your GCSE exams, which must feel like a lot with everything else you’ve got on your plate. I remember feeling similarly around exam season. What helped me stay focused was keeping a little time for myself amidst the chaos, whether that meant a short walk or reading something unrelated to studies. And by the way, your plan to keep practicing Italian on a skiing trip sounds like a great way to combine learning with something fun! It must be a bit frustrating thinking about the post-Brexit limitations for travel and work in the EU, but how fantastic that you can get an Italian passport! I, too, have always wanted to explore the world and experience life in different countries, so I can definitely relate to your dreams of traveling for work and study. I’m sure with your determination, you’ll find the balance between all these passions and make the most of this busy year. I’d love to hear more about how it all unfolds, and I wish you all the best as you prepare for your exams and your future adventures. Warm regards,
